    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      In a large pot over medium heat, cook the bacon until evenly brown, but
      not crisp. Mix in the onion, and coat with the bacon drippings. Stir in
      potatoes, and season with salt and pepper. Mix in the flour and water,
      stirring until smooth. Cover pot, and cook 10 minutes, until potatoes are
      tender.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Reduce heat to low. Gradually stir in the milk. Simmer soup 1 hour,
      stirring frequently to avoid scorching.
